        <h5>How to find someone on facebook</h5>
        <p>A real name is just the tip of the iceberg. A completely free reverse phone lookup with name won’t compare to the feeling in your gut when you match a name with a face. A social media profile, like Facebook, can reveal enough details for you to catch a cheater. People upload hundreds of personal photographs to social media every day. Do any of them contain photographs that you were never meant to see</p>

        <h4>NHỮNG CHIÊU TRÒ SPAM CÁC CUỘC GỌI NHỠ VÀ TIN NHẮN RÁC TỪ NHỮNG SỐ NẶC DANH</h4>
        <p>Missed call scams start by ringing your phone and hanging up so quickly that you can’t answer the call in time. Your phone registers a missed call and you probably won’t recognize the number. People will often then call the number back to find out who it is. Apart from being a nuisance, the missed call can ead to a scam in two ways</p>
        <p>The number you call back may be redirected to a premium rate service (a number that starts with 09) without your knowledge, which means you will be charged a lot of money per minute.</p>
        <p>The number may tell you that you have won a prize of some sort and give you another number to call to ‘claim’ your prize, but they may not tell you how much the call will cost. This second number may be a premium rate number, again charging you a lot of money to get your prize.</p>
        <p>Text message scams work by sending you a text message from a number you may not recognize, but the content of the message could sound like it’s from a friend—for instance "Hi, it’s John. I’m back! When do you want to catch up?" or "Hey big fella, happy birthday!". Another common tactic is for a text message to sound like someone flirting with you. Many people reply asking who it is and end up engaging in a lengthy SMS exchange with the scammer. Only later do they find out that they have been charged a high rate both for messages they sent (sometimes there are also charges for messages received as well).</p>

    <div class="giupban col-md-7 col-sm-6">
        <p>An SMS competition or SMS trivia scam usually arrives as a text message and may encourage you to enter a competition for a great prize (like an mp3 player). The message (or sometimes, an advertisement) could also invite you to take part in a trivia competition, with a great prize on offer if you answer a certain number of questions correctly. The scammers make money by charging extremely high rates for the messages you send, and any further messages they send to you. These charges could be as high as £2 for each message sent and/or received. With trivia scams, the first lot of questions will be very easy. This is meant to encourage you to keep playing. However, the last one or two questions that you need to answer to claim your ‘prize’ could be very difficult or impossible to answer correctly (and may even require you to guess a random number).</p>
